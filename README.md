Project Title: Reducing the risk of transmitting amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) through beaver relocations

Abstract: Global biodiversity loss is accelerating and so is the use of animal translocations to restore populations. However, translocations may have the unintended effect of transmitting pathogens, threatening recipient ecosystems. Beaver reintroductions are increasing across their historical range to create and maintain resilient wetland habitat. However, co-dispersal of pathogens could undermine expected benefits of beaver establishment for biodiversity. To reduce the risk of transmitting pathogens during relocation, pathogen-specific neutralization methods suitable for live animals are needed. We conducted a laboratory experiment to assess Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) viability on beaver pelts and assess the efficacy of five neutralization treatments. Bd maintained viability on beaver pelts for 21 days after exposure and scanning electron microscope images show Bd adhering to beaver hairs. However, drying and rinsing treatments significantly reduced Bd viability on beaver pelts. Our results suggest that simple treatments may be effective for reducing the risk of transmitting Bd during beaver relocation.
